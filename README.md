# Group-1---Project-3
Web Scraping &amp; Leaflet

Project Proposal

According to Forbes, Data Science has been rated the #1 job type in the US for 4 years in a row. We decided to search ZipRecruiter and compare other tech jobs to Data Science and see the prominence of each one, and their popular locations.

Our mission is to scrape ZipRecruiter website for the following job titles: 
Data analyst/scientist  
Software engineer 
Front end developer 

Our goal is to compare the number of positions available for each career type and their prominent locations. 

We will be scraping the following pages:
https://www.ziprecruiter.com/candidate/search?radius=100&search=data+scientist&location=irvine+CA
https://www.ziprecruiter.com/candidate/search?radius=100&search=software+engineer&location=irvine+CA
https://www.ziprecruiter.com/candidate/search?radius=100&search=front+end+developer&location=irvine+CA

We will using Leaflet to create maps, heat maps and markers. 
The first layer will be a heat map indicating hotspots for each of the career types
The second layer will be a cluster of markers indicating how many jobs are in that area.
